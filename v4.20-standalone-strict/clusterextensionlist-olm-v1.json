                        "description": "version is an optional semver constraint (a specific version or range of versions). When unspecified, the latest version available will be installed.\n\nAcceptable version ranges are no longer than 64 characters.\nVersion ranges are composed of comma- or space-delimited values and one or\nmore comparison operators, known as comparison strings. Additional\ncomparison strings can be added using the OR operator (||).\n\n# Range Comparisons\n\nTo specify a version range, you can use a comparison string like \">=3.0,\n<3.6\". When specifying a range, automatic updates will occur within that\nrange. The example comparison string means \"install any version greater than\nor equal to 3.0.0 but less than 3.6.0.\". It also states intent that if any\nupgrades are available within the version range after initial installation,\nthose upgrades should be automatically performed.\n\n# Pinned Versions\n\nTo specify an exact version to install you can use a version range that\n\"pins\" to a specific version. When pinning to a specific version, no\nautomatic updates will occur. An example of a pinned version range is\n\"0.6.0\", which means \"only install version 0.6.0 and never\nupgrade from this version\".\n\n# Basic Comparison Operators\n\nThe basic comparison operators and their meanings are:\n  - \"=\", equal (not aliased to an operator)\n  - \"!=\", not equal\n  - \"<\", less than\n  - \">\", greater than\n  - \">=\", greater than OR equal to\n  - \"<=\", less than OR equal to\n\n# Wildcard Comparisons\n\nYou can use the \"x\", \"X\", and \"*\" characters as wildcard characters in all\ncomparison operations. Some examples of using the wildcard characters:\n  - \"1.2.x\", \"1.2.X\", and \"1.2.*\" is equivalent to \">=1.2.0, < 1.3.0\"\n  - \">= 1.2.x\", \">= 1.2.X\", and \">= 1.2.*\" is equivalent to \">= 1.2.0\"\n  - \"<= 2.x\", \"<= 2.X\", and \"<= 2.*\" is equivalent to \"< 3\"\n  - \"x\", \"X\", and \"*\" is equivalent to \">= 0.0.0\"\n\n# Patch Release Comparisons\n\nWhen you want to specify a minor version up to the next major version you\ncan use the \"~\" character to perform patch comparisons. Some examples:\n  - \"~1.2.3\" is equivalent to \">=1.2.3, <1.3.0\"\n  - \"~1\" and \"~1.x\" is equivalent to \">=1, <2\"\n  - \"~2.3\" is equivalent to \">=2.3, <2.4\"\n  - \"~1.2.x\" is equivalent to \">=1.2.0, <1.3.0\"\n\n# Major Release Comparisons\n\nYou can use the \"^\" character to make major release comparisons after a\nstable 1.0.0 version is published. If there is no stable version published, // minor versions define the stability level. Some examples:\n  - \"^1.2.3\" is equivalent to \">=1.2.3, <2.0.0\"\n  - \"^1.2.x\" is equivalent to \">=1.2.0, <2.0.0\"\n  - \"^2.3\" is equivalent to \">=2.3, <3\"\n  - \"^2.x\" is equivalent to \">=2.0.0, <3\"\n  - \"^0.2.3\" is equivalent to \">=0.2.3, <0.3.0\"\n  - \"^0.2\" is equivalent to \">=0.2.0, <0.3.0\"\n  - \"^0.0.3\" is equvalent to \">=0.0.3, <0.0.4\"\n  - \"^0.0\" is equivalent to \">=0.0.0, <0.1.0\"\n  - \"^0\" is equivalent to \">=0.0.0, <1.0.0\"\n\n# OR Comparisons\nYou can use the \"||\" character to represent an OR operation in the version\nrange. Some examples:\n  - \">=1.2.3, <2.0.0 || >3.0.0\"\n  - \"^0 || ^3 || ^5\"\n\nFor more information on semver, please see https://semver.org/",
